The Odin Project Recipes

This website will allow me to demonstrate what I have learned so far during my time with The Odin Project.
This project will help me to build my HTML skills and in the future will be styled with CSS.
This project will also help me become more comfortable with Git commands such as:
"git add", "git commit" & "git push".

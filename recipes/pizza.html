      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        A delicious pizza recipe that has incredible depth of flavour from the
        sourdough crust. A little bit of extra prep but it goes a long way.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>Levain</h4>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>34g white flour (about 12.5% protein)</li>
        <li>34g water</li>
        <li>34g ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Main Dough</h4>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>573g white flour (about 12.5% protein)</li>
        <li>34g whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>34g durum flour (“extra fancy”)</li>
        <li>357g water 1</li>
        <li>27g water 2</li>
        <li>14g fine sea salt</li>
        <li>101g ripe levain</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Levain – 9:00 a.m.<br /></strong>
          Mix the levain ingredients in a jar and leave them covered at a warm
          temperature, 74-76°F (23-24°C), to ripen for 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mix – 12:00 p.m.<br /></strong>
          To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment,
          add the flour, water 1, and ripe levain. Mix on low speed for 2 to 3
          minutes until the ingredients come together and no dry bits remain.
          Increase the mixer speed to medium (I use #6 on the Famag) and mix for
          3 to 4 minutes until the dough begins to smooth. Let the dough rest in
          the bowl for 10 minutes, covered. Add the salt and water 2 to help it
          dissolve. Mix on low speed for 2 minutes until the salt is
          incorporated. Then, increase the mixer speed to medium and mix for 4
          to 5 minutes until the dough clumps around the dough hook and is
          smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a bulk fermentation
          container and cover.
        </li>

          <strong
            >Bulk fermentation – 12:15 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. (3 hours)<br
          /></strong>
          At a warm room temperature, 74-76°F (23-24°C), bulk fermentation
          should take about 3 hours. The dough does not require any sets of
          stretches and folds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Divide, ball and cold-proof – 3:15 p.m. (overnight)<br
          /></strong>
          Grease a large dough tray, half sheet pan, or four individual 4-cup
          containers with olive oil. Scrape the dough out to the counter and
          divide it into 280g pieces. Shape tightly into balls and place in the
          proofing container(s). Cover and place into the refrigerator overnight
          (or up to 2 days later).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Warm proof – 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<br /></strong>
          Take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it finish proofing at
          room temperature for 3 hours before shaping and cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shape and cook – 12:00 p.m.<br /></strong>
          Preheat your high-heat oven until the floor of the oven reaches your
          desired temperature (I prefer around 650°F/340°C). Prepare your pizza
          sauce and any other toppings. Flour a work surface and the tops of the
          dough balls. Scoop up one dough ball and flip it over onto the floured
          work surface. Sprinkle flour on top and use your hands, shaped like an
          inverted “V,” to press out the dough from top to bottom. Rotate the
          ball and press it out again. Then, flip the dough over and again, with
          your hands shaped like an inverted “V,” press the dough out. Next,
          pick up the dough with your hands, make fists, and drape the dough
          over your knuckles. Gently and slowly, pull your hands apart to
          stretch the dough. Rotate the dough over your hands and continue to
          stretch in this way a few more times until the dough has spread to
          about 10-inches in diameter. Lay the dough back on the work surface.
          Top the dough with sauce, cheese, and any toppings suitable for
          cooking in the oven. Slide the dough onto a pizza peel, and then slide
          it into the oven. Cook and repeat with remaining dough.
